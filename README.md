Unique materials with useful features

<strong>This mod adds:</strong>

- Zurite => A material with some Netherite properties, including fire and knockback resistance. While it is less durable, it is cheaper to craft and has the autorepairing feature
- Traveler's Relic, Fragment => A relic that can save the playerâ€™s position (Crouch + right-click to set location) and teleport back to that location (Hold right-click to teleport). It can be split into three fragments, which work similarly but can only link to an Anchor Stone or Lodestone
- Link Relic => Is created by combining two Traveler's Relic Fragments. Can be linked to a player (right-click to link), allowing teleportation directly to that player (Hold right-click to teleport)
- Anchor Stone => Serves as a link point for Traveler's Relic
